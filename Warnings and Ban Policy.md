Moderation of this server is a difficult job and often exists in gray areas. As a community manager you have the power to warn people and time them out with the following commands.
## Warn
`/moderation warn {user} {reason}`
`/moderation warn @Ethn#1225 Being rude`

We use warns to track when staff have to speak to members about their behavior. Warns are not an indication that something needs to be done but as a record keeping system for us. If you interact with a user in a moderation context please issue a warning so we can track it across all community managers and moderators.

If you warn a user and you see they have several warnings talk to a mod or Sr. Community Manager to determine if the user should be timed out or banned. (see Timeout section for timeout duration suggestions)

## Timeout
    `/moderation timeout: {user} reason{explanation} duration:{duration}`
    `/moderation timeout: @Ethn#1225 reason: Being rude duration: 7d`
-  Duration of timeouts is at your discretion, 
    - if it is a minor infraction timeout on the scale of 1-24 hours
    - If it is a second timout or the user is being extra difficult timeout on the scale of 1-3 days
    - If it is a third timeout or the user is being extraordinarily difficult timeout on the scale of 1-4 weeks
	    - If you find yourself wanting to time someone out for this long talk to a mod because we probably want to ban them.


## Bans
Sr. Community Managers have the ability to ban users. Bans should be issued when a user clearly breaks server rules like smurfing or being hateful towards other members. 

`/moderation ban {user} reason:{reason}`
`/moderation ban @Ethn#1225 reason: Being rude, submit an unban request at https://unban.woohoojin.dev`

Please ensure in all bans that you list a reason and include that they can submit an unban request at https://unban.woohoojin.dev

Bans are at your discretion, please ensure that you provide a valid reason and that you can articulate why the user got banned. If you abuse the power to ban you will no longer have that power.



## Mod Mail

To view and answer ModMail tickets you will need the `@Mod Mail Answerer` role. This role should be assigned to all Sr. Community Managers, and will be assigned to Community Managers as they become more comfortable with the moderation process.

### Answering ModMail Tickets

In order to answer tickets you must use the prefix `=reply {message}` or `=aprely {message}` to reply and let the user see which moderator is replying or to hide the name and reply anonymously.
- Unless there is a reason to reply with your name, please default to using `=areply` to respond to tickets.  
- When answering tickets please remain respectful. 

To close a ticket use the command `=close {message}` or `=aclose {message}` to close the ticket with your name or anonymously.  
-  Unless there is a reason to close with your name, please default to using `=aclose` to close tickets
    - When closing a ticket it sends the message to the user who submitted so please ensure closing messages remain respectful and topical.
