**Why so many rules?**
	VOD reviews are meant to help you climb the ranks. These rules ensure that VODs are of players already familiar with their role and agent, maximizing learning potential.  

***These rules are premilnary coaching. If your vod and playtime consistency does not meet the requirements the only advice you would get would be to play until you meet these requirements. Ensuring you meet these requirements is the first step in imporvement.***

**1. How do I get my VOD reviewed?**
	Get your VOD approved in vod-submission to enter the raffle. I run raffles 2-3 times per stream for VOD review in üé∞Ô∏±raffles-and-predictions. Check the events button on Discord for upcoming stream times. 

**2. What type of VOD is best to submit?**
	I prefer games with a close score line where you felt you performed well. Mistakes made in your good matches are mistakes you'll make in every match. 

**3. Do I need to Comm in-game?** 
Attempted pre-round plans are required. 
- Example of acceptable pre-round plan: "Phoenix, I'll put this cage up for you to flash out of if they push us."
- NOT acceptable pre-round plan: "Let's all go to A."

	There is too much lost value in games where you are not communicating, and this makes the coaching experience far less valuable. Comm‚Äôing only with your duo in Discord does not count. 
	
**4. Can I submit a VOD where I Fill? Is Filling okay?** 
	No Fill VODs or trackers with excessive filling.  We consider filling playing more than 1 agent per map. If you are immortal+ a second agent on each map is acceptable. This requirement is to make sure that your VOD review is not spent covering the basics of your role/agent if you are not playing them enough. 

**5. How Consistent is Consistent?**
		In order to get effective vod review you should be playing consistently. We are requiring that 10 of the last 14 days show gameplay on your tracker.gg profile. This is to ensure that the advice you get can (1) be useful to you when you win a raffle, and (2) ensure that the vods being reviewed on stream are of the highest quality. If you only play once every 2 weeks you won't be able to implement the advice effectively.
    
**6. How much do VOD Reviews Cost? **
	VOD reviews have always been, and will always be completely free of charge. Starting January 10, 2023 all VODs must contain you typing "Good Luck" in all chat in round 1 to show you have read all of the VOD review requirements. Discord subscribers get extra tickets for increased odds to win raffles, but anyone can win at any time. See [https://discord.com/channels/915336728707989534/role-subscriptions](https://discord.com/channels/915336728707989534/role-subscriptions "https://discord.com/channels/915336728707989534/role-subscriptions") for the exact details of the subscription benefits. 
	
 **7. Can I submit a vod in another language? **
 
 Yes! VODs can be submitted in any language as long as you are able to translate comms into English if asked during stream. 
 
 **UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, VODS ON BIND WILL NOT BE ALLOWED.** 
 **NO MUSIC ALLOWED IN VODS**
    
### DUOS / TRIOS / 5-STACKS
    
**1. Can I submit a Ranked game where I'm playing with friends?** 
	Duo/Trio queue is fine if your duo/trio are not significantly better/worse than you. For 5stack, please see the message under this one. 
	
**2. Can I submit a 5-stack VOD?** 
	All five members of the team must be members of the discord for at least a week and found in üë™Ô∏±lf-5stack. You will be required to ping them in stream chat when your vod is reviewed. All other vod review rules still apply. No scrims.

	
***TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQ EXPLANATIONS***

**1. Why can't I accept the vod review rules?** 
You must have your rank role assigned in the server to ensure you are Gold+. Head over to #üèÜÔ∏±rank-icon. If you have issues, please DM @MOD MAIL for assistance. 

**Why don't you review Reyna?** 

This is a personal restriction. I believe Reyna is a feast or famine agent that is heavily lacking in strong utility. She relies on your personal ability to frag out; and my coaching style is the opposite of this. My coaching will help you rank up even if you're a weak fragger. On the flipside, I'm not the best at teaching people how to frag out, so Reyna is a very bad fit for me. **Why no Astra for lower than immortal?** Astra is an incredibly complicated agent and relies far too much on your teammates to be truly effective. Below immortal you are always better off playing other controllers.

***Why no vods under Gold?***
	The game doesn't really start until you reach gold. Under that rank you should simply focus on your mechanics, lock reyna and frag out. I have created a practice routine that can be found here: https://youtu.be/9KIoTtohkOQ
