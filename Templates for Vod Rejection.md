Hi <user>, Unfortunately, we are rejecting your VOD. We know it is disappointing, but it means that you can improve even more before receiving free coaching from Woohoojin. For what it's worth, users returning after they have incorporated our requirements are usually at a higher rank than the last time they submitted. **Your VOD was rejected for not fulfilling the following requirement(s)/restriction(s):**

```
1. No filling. You must main an agent and have experience with them.
Not having a main limits your performance and VOD reviews are not basic agent guides. If you play too many agents, then you either do not have a main, or you do not have enough familiarity with them to deserve a review. Your Tracker history must clearly display a main agent that you play in the overwhelming majority of your matches and not show you filling often.
```

Please keep playing your main agent. Right now, you do not have enough recent gameplay with them.


```
2. Make pre-round plans.
You must attempt to coordinate plays with your team before the round starts for the entire match. Bad plans are better than no plans. 

Example of an acceptable plan: "Phoenix, I'll put this cage up for you to flash out of if they push us." ✅ 
Example of a low-effort plan that does not count: "Let's all go to A." ❌

Communicating with your duo in Discord instead of communicating with your team is not acceptable.
```

You did not attempt enough pre-round plans. Please keep doing your best to coordinate with your team. Remember, bad plans are better than no plans.

```
3. Play consistently.
Upon VOD submission, you must have played at least 1 Comp match per 11 of the last 14 days - a maximum of 3 days off over the last 2 weeks. Anything less is not consistent enough to ensure that your VOD is of your best gameplay with these requirements implemented and therefore it will be rejected.
```

You are not playing enough. Please improve your consistency so that we know you are playing at your best.

```
1. Duo/Trio Queue is fine if they are not significantly better or worse than you. This is your review, not theirs.
```

The impact of your other party member(s) is too high or too low, negatively affecting your ability to impact the match. Please find a party closer to your skill level or try solo queue.

```
2. 5-Stack VOD reviews require all teammates to be members of the Discord for at least a week. You will be required to ping them in #stream-chat when your VOD is reviewed. All other VOD review requirements still apply.
```

Please make sure that all your party members are in this Discord and that your VOD follows all other requirements.

```
1. No Reyna.
Reyna is a feast or famine agent that lacks strong utility and Woohoojin's coaching does not rely on fragging to climb. Emphasizing fragging by reviewing Reyna VODs misleads players about what is important for ranking up.
```

```
2. No Astra unless Immortal+.
Astra is an incredibly complicated agent and relies too much on your teammates to be effective. Below Immortal, you are better off playing other controllers.
```

```
4. Read the rest of this channel.
Do it.
